## Markdown
### Introduction 
**Markdown** is a lightweight *markup language* for creating **formatted text using a plain-text editor**. 
***John Gruber*** created Markdown in ***2004*** as an easy-to-read markup language. 
Markdown is widely used for :
- **blogging and instant messaging**
- **online forums**
- **collaborative software**
- **documentation pages**
- **readme files**
The initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and raised unanswered questions, causing implementations to both intentionally and accidentally diverge from the original version. 
This was addressed in 2014 when long-standing Markdown contributors released CommonMark, an unambiguous specification and test suite for Markdown.
### Why Markdown
Markdown should be the tool of choice for anyone who prioritizes simplicity, flexibility, and control over their documents and writing process.
1. **Simplicity**
It’s a very simple way of notating and structuring content. It only has a few features: headers, hierarchical lists, links, images, quotes, dividers, and tables. That’s it. Markdown is simple.

**Easy to learn**: Some might see its learning curve as a barrier, but still simpler than learning Word or Google Docs for the first time and certainly easier than complex markup languages like HTML
**Easy to write**: The small number of features enables the syntax to be used effortlessly while writing
**Easy to read**: The syntax is clean, intuitive and digestible by anyone when reading the raw text - even people unfamiliar with the syntax.
These features cover most writing needs and perfectly suited for the needs of a personal knowledge base. Even if it falls short for some tasks, I argue that it’s the best starting point before converting to more complex formats.

However, being a simple “plain text” file gives it a few important qualities:

Compatibility: Because Markdown files are plain text, they are highly portable and can be opened and edited in any text editor, on any operating system, making them accessible regardless of the technology you use.
Durability: Markdown files are less likely to become corrupted or unreadable over time, as they are not tied to a specific software version or platform.
This makes it ideal for knowledge preservation in the long term. It’s a format that will be readable in 10, 20, or 50 years from now.

2. **Flexibility**
Whether it’s the act of writing, or everything you plan to do with your written content, Markdown is the king of flexibility.

**Limitless writing options**
Sure you can write in any text editor, but there are many markdown-specific writing apps that can enhance the experience. Some of the most popular ones include:
- ghostwriter
- Formiko
- ReText
- Typora
- StackEdit
- Dillinger
- MarkdownPad
- Markdown Edit
Don’t want to deal with the syntax? No problem. Need a focus mode? Got it. Need to edit on the phone? No problem. Need to sync between devices? Easy. Have to have built in publishing features? Done. Whatever writing workflow you are looking for there are tools available to help you.

3. **Portability**
As you can see, with Markdown your content is not tied to a specific app or platform, and you are free to pick up and switch to a new app at any time. This is not the case with proprietary formats or cloud-based solutions.
